Overview
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Organize my files and file systems in a complete, standardized manner which
 is easy to access and parse.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Context
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most of my work and many of my personal thoughts and memories are kept digitally
, usually on a Linux ext4 file-system in my personal computer.
 As the size and number of files increases, it becomes difficult to keep
 all of that information ordered, which then causes issues and delays when
 trying to locate important information, especially if it's fairly old.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While as mentioned my central work environment is on my personal computer
 in a Linux environment, I actually have four environments where I keep
 files and use regularly.
 Each is named, under my general username theme of All-Seeing:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
AllSeer
\series default
: the Linux environment on my personal computer, via dual boot
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
NoSeer
\series default
: the Windows environment on my personal computer, via dual boot
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
MiniSeer
\series default
: the Android environment on my personal smartphone
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
GSeer
\series default
: the file system on my personal Google Drive account.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
AllSeer, MiniSeer and NoSeer are all separate from each other and keep their
 files locally.
 GSeer is stored on the cloud (on Google servers) and can be accessed via
 the Google Drive web app.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When possible, I prefer to mount the file systems on one another for easy
 access.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As I prefer a Linux environment, I try to use Linux emulators that can access
 the file system, if such emulators exist.
 On NoSeer, the app CygWin is installed, which can run many Linux programs
 and has access to the windows file system.
 On MiniSeer, I have TEL installed, a modified version of Termux, a Linux
 distribution/emulator that can also access the Android file system.
 Termux does not follow standard Linux file structure and some script paths
 may change for it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Goals

\begin_layout Itemize

 Home Directories
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each file system will have a defined 
\emph on
Home Directory
\emph default
.
 Excluding system and app files as necessary, I will only edit and write
 files inside that directory (reading is allowed everywhere).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The home directory may contain app configuration or data folders only as
 necessary, and if possible they must be hidden.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Specifically:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
AllSeer's

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
GSeer's
\series default
 home directory is 
\family typewriter
My Drive
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ideally, the home directory is local (for better speeds) and supports symbolic
 and hard links.
 If possible, then when its directories are explored normally, and both
 in terminal and in file explorer, only personal or manually created files
 are displayed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If environment variables are supported, the HOME variable should lead here.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The file explorer should have the home directory bookmarked (be it automatically
 via HOME variable or manually).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If possible, the home directory should be the default directory when opening
 a file explorer or a terminal emulator.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The home directories should be as synchronized as possible between devices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When describing paths, I may write 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 instead of the project directory paths.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection

 Project & Aspect directories
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In each home directory (as enumerated in 
\shape slanted
System210630A
\shape default
), there should be a directory for each aspect detailed in 
\shape slanted
CONTROL/System210606A
\shape default
, named identically to them: Red, Purple, Green, Gray, Steel and Blue.
 These will be called 
\emph on
Aspect Directory
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each project's 
\emph on
Project Directory
\emph default
 (as ruled by 
\shape slanted
CONTROL/System210606B
\shape default
) will be a sub-directory of its aspect's directory, named identically to
 the project.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Though project may delineate systems that request rulings or expansions
 in other projects—for example as CONTROL demands FILER to detail the structure
 and location of Project Directories—any of the files its own systems demands

status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
excepting project statements as detailed in 
\shape slanted
CONTROL/System210606C 
\shape default
and all systems in this project
\end_layout

\end_inset

 must remain within its project directory.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If two systems from different projects require work on the same file, the
 file should be created in the project directory of one of them and then
 linked (symbolically or not, as deemed appropriate,) in the other one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Other than maintaining a project statement in the top level of the directory
 (as detailed in 
\shape slanted
CONTROL/System210606C
\shape default
) and a symbolic link to its archive directory (as detailed in 
\shape slanted
System210630C
\shape default
), a project directory should be freely structured within the systems of
 its project.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The visible contents of the home directories should be mostly identical
 and synced between my four devices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection

Projects Shortcut Directory
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the top level of the home directory, an additional directory called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Projects
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 should be created and contain symbolic links to each project directory.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The symbolic links should be relative (e.g 
\family typewriter
../Gray/FILER
\family default
 rather than 
\family typewriter
/home/atai/Gray/FILER
\family default
).
 This is to make backup and restore easier across devices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The purpose of this is to make access to known projects more easily, while
 having a more categorical overview if needed (in the form of the aspect
 directories,) and avoiding long messy lists.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection

\bar under
210630C
\bar default
 Archive Directories & Archiving
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the top level of this Project Directory, there should be an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Archives
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 directory.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Archives directory should have a sub-directory for each project named
 of the form 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

{ID}.{PROJECT}{SIGN}
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, where ID is the project ID, PROJECT is the project's name and sign is
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

+
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 if the project is ongoing, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 if it's frozen and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 otherwise.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A project's system should specify archiving procedures that will run as
 long as the project is ongoing.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The archiving systems should remove project files that are no longer relevant
 to it, but preserve files that could be used as reference or simply for
 memory; these files should be placed in the archive directory and structured
 according to the archiving system or systems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As long as at least one of a project's systems is actively practiced, it
 is considered 
\emph on
ongoing.
 
\emph default
All of the above systems apply to it, and its archive directory should be
 suffixed with 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

+
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When an ongoing project has no active systems and they are not meant to
 be activated again for at least 3 months, the project should be considered
 
\emph on
archived
\emph default
 — any of its current contents that are deemed relevant for preservation
 should be moved to the archive directory, its project directory should
 be removed as long with its 
\family typewriter
~/Projects
\family default
 shortcut, and the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

+
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 suffix should be removed from its archived directory name.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When a project's systems are not meant to be practiced for two weeks at
 least but are meant to be activated again in at most 3 months, the project
 should be considered 
\emph on
frozen
\emph default
.
 Any files that are should be irrelevant for the reactivation should be
 removed or achieved according to their significance.
 Then, the remaining contents of the directory should move to a sub directory
 in the archive, called a 
\emph on
state archive
\emph default
.
 Then, the now empty project directory should be removed along with its
 
\family typewriter
~/Project 
\family default
link.
 The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

+
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 suffix of its archive directory should be replaced with 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

-
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When a frozen project is no longer meant to be reactivated, the content
 of its state archived should be examined and archived as deemed necessary.
 Then the state archived should be removed along with the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

-
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 suffix of the archive directory.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The top level of each Project Directory should contain a symbolic link to
 its archive, named 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Archive
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A major currently ongoing task of this system is the handling of previously
 created archives and structures that are currently revamped under the Foundatio

 This includes shell startup and environment variables, system startup apps,
 preferences and settings for each app, URL to IP override, and so on.

\begin_layout Standard
Each project should have a specified

a way to backup its Project Directory into the cloud and sync it between

 Such solution should generally keep the Project and Archive directories
 identical across file system through most points in time, but allow exclusions

 The project directory should be initialized as a git repository.
 A bare repository should be initialized via GitHub, under the user AtaiAmbus.
 The bare repo should be set private.

Using git and GitHub as a cloud solution comes with a few convenient benefits:
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
GitHub provides a simple and very straightforward way of browsing the files
 online, which will display text files as is and can also handle many common

Version Control makes for additional backup and archiving measure, and can

\begin_layout Standard
The main disadvantage of using 
\family typewriter
git
\family default
 is that it is very slow when large files are involved, and though GitHub
 allowed a very high ceiling of 100GB per repository, individual files cannot
 exceed the sometimes small 50MB.
 As a result, this cloud solution distinctly does not fit project with a
 lot of media files, and in general should be employed when the project
 mostly consists of text files.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If a file in a git project should be linked to another location, a symbolic
 link should be used, with the source at the git repository.
 Using a symbolic link the other way would cause git to only track the symlink
 path rather than the actual file, and git severs hard links when it pulls
 (though if deemed necessary, it seems they can be re-linked automatically
 with a

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that there is currently no way to access the actual files used with
 google apps (google docs, google slides, etc.), and sync/mount tools only
 offer links to the actual document or converted versions of it.
 As such, these files cannot be fully synced; instead they should be kept
 with web link desktop file (done automatically in the

 If no tools are available to do this process automatically, Google API

\begin_layout Standard
This is considered less convenient than git, the solution being far more

 Furthermore, it also uses one of the devices as a central host, which can

\begin_layout Standard
The first condition may apply to project that contain short videos and high

 If the overall size of the project exceeds roughly 500MB and does not exceed
 2GB, then it should fall in the appropriate range.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second condition mainly applies for non-code collaborative projects,
 due to google's friendly interface and the ease of simultaneous editing.
 The general reasoning for this condition is that in these cases, GSeer

 it would end up syncing mostly links.

A full index of the files on the hard drive should be kept as an appendix

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is generally intended for very heavy projects, that weigh many gigabytes
 of data — for example, seasons of TV shows, movies and so on.
 Using git or Google Drive on these project is infeasible, due to the size
 constraint outlined above.
 Regardless, such projects should generally not be fully synced, as they
 can weigh very on the file system.
 Rather, I opt for the solution above, which has a host repository on a
 separate, large drive, making all the data accessible and with relatively
 quick transfer, but allowing for more modular need-to-use system, to prevent
 the project from clogging up available storage and slowing down the computer.
\end_layout

Note that it would be most easy to enact the synchronization via AllSeer,
 mounting the other file systems unto it.
 That way there is much less need to play with different connections and
 moving between devices.

GSeer also contains old data ranging from as early as 2010, all the way

 This should be backed up complelty, maybe even twice.

 An issue remains, in the fact that any local storage of drive files requires
 conversion to other formats in which data may be lost; transferring the

 The /tmp Directory and Intended Creation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a general rule, each file which is created on the computer or transferred
 to it must have an intended use and therefore also a matching project.
 More specifically, actions are generally done to achieve some mesa-objective,
 which is generally be definition a project.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Simply put, any file which is relevant for a brief period of time (roughly
 three days or less) should be put in the 
\family typewriter
/tmp
\family default
 directory.
 Examples include: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Specific instructions before tests or IDF sorting
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Media reactions from instant-messaging apps
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Script testing files
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And so on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When a new file has no appropriate project, creation of a new project should
 be considered; however, if no actual long term mesa-objective is relevant,
 it is presumed to be meant for a short concrete action, and therefore goes
 into 
\family typewriter
/tmp
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Considering the premises above, 
\family typewriter
/tmp
\family default
 is determined as the default location of any newly created or newly transferred
 or downloaded files, especially ones that cannot be directly created or
 transferred into their appropriate location upon creation or transfer.
 Central applications of this include making 
\family typewriter
/tmp
\family default
 the default downloads directory and the screenshots directory, but it generally
 expands to any app or system function that creates or downloads files I'll
 later manually use — transmission's default download directory, LyX's default
 working directory, and so on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is all nice and pretty, but the 
\family typewriter
/tmp

directory really only exists on AllSeer.
 Its behaviour can be emulated though — CygWin's
