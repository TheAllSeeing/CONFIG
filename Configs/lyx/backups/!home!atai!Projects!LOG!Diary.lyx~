For some reason I remembered the time we need to go out an hour late and
 then I definitely missed the 6:50 mark, but it was well.
 I organized fairly slowly, walked Dvash, discovered that the plan was 6:50,
 hurriedly gathered the food and my glasses, put on shoes, and we wend to
 Tel Hashomer.

A quiet morning so far.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I woke up at 7:40, after probably the weirdest dream I ever had (including
 grandma Eti as an elephant who joked about brutally murdering me), and
 organized fairly quickly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I intended to drink tea (and the AC was on so it was fitting), but Dvash
 cried to me like crazy, so I walked her.
 It was pretty hot outside, so I just did not feel like tea after.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By 8:40 I was back on the computer; Checked Emails - some incredibly nostalgic
 messages.
 A reminder from Sdarot (which, btw, really support is ran by a Likudnic,
 ugh) and a notification about a reply on a Gravity Falls Forum; A post
 from 2017.
 There was confusion for a code talking about 1000 years in the future,
 the show being set in 2012 and present being 2020.
 I had considered organizing the timeline for them, for old times sake,
 but then say I kinda already did that in my old comment on that post (that
 was the reason I got the email notification).
 I decided against it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another Email was an XKCD notification, and I ended browsing that site for
 another ten minutes, but after that and an additional two minutes quickly
 checking how to properly filter commands for the last hour (see Insight-1
 for more on that), I launch my docs and started organizing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I resorted the tasks, marked successes and failures for routines, and resorted
 bills.
 Then I moved unto the Day Report.
 I reorganized tasks and schedule (see decision-4).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dad needed some help transporting part of his old desk, as he was organizing
 the back patio.
 I helped.
 Then I went back up, update my report's timeline a bit, ans started a Journal!

I woke up around 6:15, and snoozed for another 10 minutes, then realized
 that I need to snooze to 6:45 to sleep my intended 7 hours, then tried
 very very awkwardly to go back to sleep after the snooze ended, for that
 20 minutes, but just kind of failed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I actually 
\emph on
got
\emph default
 up at 6:45, and organized.
 As I was brushing my teeth, I thought about buying dice for TAHEL, if we
 actually play AD&D.
 I checked out sales, and after going through amazon (shipping far too pricey),
 freak and the kingdom (just kind of bland), I found Mist, that sold at
 a lower price and exactly the variety I needed.
 Rounding it up it would be 146 Shekels, including delivery.
 Shiny orange, red, white, black dice, and metallic silver for me (which
 cost 3 shekels more).
 See Appendix-1 and Appendix-2.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At any rate, I finishe
\color yellow
d organizin

g, stared at the dice for a bit, went downstairs, cleared the dishwasher,
 set up week report (a bit).
 I also managed a day report.
 I wondered off a lot though; At first into finishing my automatic LyX PDF
 updater, which after an hour or maybe a bit less I finally finished.

I wondered farther, into Everlib and its current Range half done infrastructure
 and uncommitted changes - see Decision-1 and Work-2 and Work-3.
 Yahli got back, and I went to grandma's to bring her beer.
 I continued the reports - and this journal.
 I updated relevant todos and overall just organized with relatively little
 genuine external project work.
 We had lunch early - enough for me to get to robotics around time (15 minutes
 late, but I managed to talk with Tom before and it was fine).

I woke up at 5:20, the dark still covering the outside.
 After a 10 minute snooze I very slowly grouched from my bed, only by 5:40
 or so I was actually up.
 I organized fairly quickly, made tea and watched the sunrise, sitting on
 the stone pile this time, drinking tea.
 It was very unique and, just, beautiful.
 The patterns of light were literally a-mazing and when the sun rose I quickly
 moved to the usual position and watched it as it rose; There was fog and
 so I was able to watch it directly and I was very happy.

I returned home, opened my computer and started the newly resurrected Bamba

 With the heat outside and it being around 11:00 already, it was not nice

 the beach taking many many hours of potential productivity.
 I tried to set up fish and omf on termux meanwhile, but the app threw a

 to org on mobile, but after it got long and I felt hollow, I decided to
 go on to reports.
 I started organizing.
 It being 12:00 at this point though, I am very frustrated with my almost
 6 lost hours of doing things.
 Nothing I can do it though.
 I set up some more tasks for the week, and wrote this journal.

We had a final Civic Studies lesson, mostly consisting of a Kahoot over

 Still, it would be best to prepare for the Civic Studies test.

For rest, I just downloaded and watched the new episode of The Boys (15:30).
 It was interesting, and there was a win for a change! But it still has

 Intentionally, but still not fun.

 I thought of a thing about a riddle I made Tom and conversed about with
 Shir, and sent it it was quite funny (see appendix-1).
 I went back - opened the door for Dvash and pet her a little - as she went
 back before me and could not open the door, she was quite stressed, and
 then worked on my new Logger thing, killing about an hour and a half -
 kinda sad, to be honest.
 I really need to be careful with easy projects like this.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I tinkered just a bit more with the Logger, logging this very entry.
 I played a bit with ipython and QUEST, deleting entries that were never
 filled.
 Before I finished I was called for breakfast, to set the table - before
 Yahli goes for another army rehearsal.
 Where my parents actually advise lying to cops, because the army does not
 really take people on days without public transport, and the thing is kinda
 complicated (they chose to go for a rehearsal since the performance is
 close).

 I prepared for the Civics quiz, kind of well?

Then I made the incredibly dumb decision of not eating breakfast before
 the quiz, resulting in me spending the first two thirds of it being very

 I don't think I did very well, but I guess it does not matter that much.
 The quiz was pretty dumb in it of itself, as we could basically do whatever
 we wanted on the computer with nobody overseeing it, although he did force
 us to open our cameras and occasionally our mics.

 I run - all 5 kilometers, nearly completely continuously (50-meter breaks

 It was so much flipping fun! An zombies run - half of the season one 10k

 I even did the circuit training after quite well, and I am starting to

We ate dinner together - really all of us, including Jessie - and it was

 We talked quite a bit more, and then I took my thought from yesterday,

 I read a bit more news, then made the decision to turn off news notifications
 - as part of the new project INFORM.
 I also added a sleep tab to the logger, and accepted my proposal to merge
 it with journal.
 In parallel I read a bit about sleep trackers.

Even though I only fell asleep at 00:34, I naturally woke up at 7:00, and
 have been pretty drowsy ever since.
 I tried to go to sleep for a bit, and didn't really manage.
 Although I also just preferred waking up earlier, and also had a really
 interesting dream I did not want to forget.

\begin_layout Standard
That was a mouthful.
 At any rate I organized quickly, and took Dvash, and the weather is terrible,
 and then I tried to fix something with the sleep graphs, to no avail, and
 finally read a bit of XKCD, Running into 1190: Time.
 An animation uploaded frame by frame, every hour, or half an hour, for
 124 days.
 An insane project, a whole story and lore and a really, really cool project.
 I didn't watch the full thing - I went here instead.
 And man I missed writing down cool dreams.

 Time and the chance is lost.
 I didn't go to open the door for Dvash and I was a bit sad for her.
 I opened my computer and docs, and started working: I finished last week's
 report, and answered the morning question.
 I also merged the questions into a final diary, and billed that I just
 move to using the full diaries only, in LOG as well.
 Then I got here, and logged my sleep, which then caused a slight bug with
 me technically going to sleep yesterday twice, (after midnight and then
 at the later night).
 So I messed with it a bit and also cleaned some stuff.
 And then finished this.

 and have certain discussion just with that group,.
 I'll admit I am a bit scared of the miscommunication.
 But especially this year, if that's what they want to do, they can go for
 it.
 But in internal software management - I just don't really see a reason

 My Mom woke me up at 6:35.
 Ugh.

\begin_layout Standard
I took a walk tough, with Dvash, and I got some of the prettiest images
 so far.
 A giant rainbow, clear and colorful.
 A puddle with a day of rain clear of clouds.
 Fields of Venice - the water covering every inch between the flowerbeds
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I bumbled, telegram and news and...
 knowyourmeme, notably.
 I ate cereals for breakfast and then went to Tom at 9:00.
 I decided to block XKCD, XKCD explained and knowyourmeme.
 Easily distracted, I suppose.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I love tuna songs, and my liked songs in general.

\begin_layout Standard
I worked with Tom on a variety of things, but at the end of the day we got
 not much done.
 In Treetop, we decided to implement User as a special kind of Unit, and
 we played a bit with Firebase to get how it works.
 I think we got the concepts, but actual code is still pending.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We worked on the experiment, but not understanding the format, we still
 indeed kind of fumbled around.
 And I've just been feeling so...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Asleep, again.
 It's weird — and I do not like it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I went for a rainy walk, with Tom's coat, and sat a long little while against
 his house from Hapalmach.
 Technically against his neighbor two houses away, I suppose, but the point
 still stands.
 The rain was weak , and pleasant, and there was a large puddle, clean and
 clear and sharp.
 I felt...
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It felt like I am 
\shape slanted
trying

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But I part of it was a, creative instinct, a need to write, I think.
 I want to start doing that.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I went back, eventually, not much progress, nothing crystallized.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And we moved on to robotics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At 16:00, I am already much out of energy, and today was not different and

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tom barely listens, and I just...
 
\shape slanted
try

\begin_layout Standard
I think Friday Schnitzels is my second favorite song, immediately after

I rested, and OSP make, great videos.
 Yahav's experiment ice cream was nice.

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Standard
Let's do a math test every week.
 I need to practice test taking anyway, and that will give me good feedback

 Dvash got scared so I helped her back and went again.

 At any case, the brought burekas,which I am ashamed to admit was my breakfast.

My troddling for the next three hours was...
 shameful.
 Mostly newspaper and Twitter.
 My phone was still in the shop and disconnected, and so I still did not

 I tried to contact Shir to maybe please download telegram for a bit, but
 she, well, probably ghosted me, sadly.

 Humph.
 Then, my dad brought my phone.
 I messaged quickly to Shir, but didn't really have an energy to talk.
 Whatmore, I saw that Limor, in response to my organized resistance, has
 decided I do not feel the

 But I suppose, oh well.

\begin_layout Standard
I spent about another hour trying to debug the Unicode issue but to no avail.
 To get refreshed, I decided to first go on a walk.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And that was, utterly beautiful.
 I never noticed how pretty the clear skies are — and I could see the moon.
 I walked through tall mallows and listened to brilliant music and it was
 just, so, so, peaceful.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dad called me back for lunch so my little hike was cut rather abruptly,
 but at least Shakshuka is pretty tasty.
 I actually tried still to debug Unicode after, but eventually just faded
 to YouTube, and Netflix.
 At this point, I was extremely low on energies.
 I watched

 her up.
 Then, I came.

Apperantly she slept for over 16 hours, 20:00-12:00, except a little before

 It was interesting, and fun.
 I feel like we got a lot closer.
 I learned she had a crush on em on and off since seventh grade, she has
 a scar on her hand from when she was a toddler, although I can't remember
 precisely.
 She wanted to tell me she loved me back, she was grateful for winning against
 corona, in the widest sense, loved her family, and many more things.
 We also broke into an argument over death and immortality, watced most
 of Hamilton, and ate lunch (her grandma's schnizels).
 And she is so fucking adorable when she sings the words to a song she likes,
 and so muchI feel, we got much closer.
 I also talked, about how I feel for her, and how I feel for the world.
 We bonded.
 And we held together, tightly, and I liked that.
 We stared into each other's eyes for four full minutes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I love her, and I think I missed her, dearly.
 I just feel...
