Context
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is one of my first titled Projects, a descendant of an especially old
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Life Management
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, somewhere before the strike of COVID-19.
 It is supposed to be kind of a to-do-list on steroids, just organizing
 all of the stuff I need to do, and originally my journal, as well.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The base gist was a combination of a well-organized to-do-list, including
 scheduling and deadlining and sub-tasking without limit as I saw fit, and
 a journal that allowed more reflection; the journaling grew more complex
 as I tried to get more insight into my own life — at the cost of actual
 progress in it.
 I tried to expand mood tracking, that I did in the past, and tried to exactly
 time all of my actions; and then more activity, location, people, sleep,
 food, and so on.
 That ended quite quickly.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As time progressed and I experimented with different forms of that, it coalesced
 mainly unto 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Progress Reports

 — which detail Outline, Status, Results and Conclusions for each day, with

For each season — Autumn, Winter, Spring, Summer, pick a

 for progress.
 A theme (as inspired by

Product), is a broad, directional and resonant word that embodies a rough
 area I would like to invest in.
 Examples include Health, Clarity, Less, Foundations, and so on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Broad
\series default
 — meaning there is a plethora of ways to invest in the area, that can be
 very different from each other — health can be mental or physical.
 Physical health can be about diet, sleep, hygiene or exercise, each of
 which a subject that could be tackled in many, many different ways by itself.
 Broadness insures that the subject remains fitting and workable even as
 reality changes drastically.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Directional
\series default
 — meaning that it genuinely can direct me to different projects and goals,
 and make judgment between decisions.
 A Spring of Success, for example, would generally be 
\shape slanted
too
\shape default
 broad; it is somewhat inconcrete, and does not say anything about how to
 achieve that success.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Resonant
\series default
 — meaning that it genuinely resonates with me, I genuinely desire to improve
 in the subject, and I feel an at least rough understanding of how to approach
 it 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Themes can work on the current state — for example 
\shape slanted
Health
\shape default
 and 
\shape slanted
Family
\shape default
 are both valid themes with very concrete goals; They can also be more vague
 — I used 
\shape slanted
Standing Up
\shape default
, just as a general idea of getting out of bad habits and people and unproductiv
ity, without specifics in mind.
 They can also work on form: 
\shape slanted
Clarity
\shape default
 deals with how we approach things and how we make decisions.
 
\shape slanted
Less
\shape default
 is a fairly meta theme, about taking 
\shape slanted
less
\shape default
 goals.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unlike most other orientation objects, theme do not delineate a precise
 goal state.
 Even with the more concrete Health and Family, the idea is never to get
 some Specific, Measurable, Attainable or even Time-Bound goal.
 There is no need to be nervous about reaching some specific things.
 The idea is 
\shape slanted
improvement.

 Aspects 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In general, I assign everything I need to talk about a color, called an
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

aspect
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, which roughly corresponds with a base motivation (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

axiom
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) as delineated by 
\emph on
Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs
\emph default
 (see appendix-A).
 Specifically:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\color red
Red 
\color inherit
corresponds with physiological needs — health, food, sleep, etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\color pink
Pink
\color inherit
 corresponds with sexual needs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\color purple
Purple 
\color inherit
corresponds with psychological needs — love, belongingness and esteem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\color green
Green
\color inherit
 corresponds with self-actualization needs, specifically through learning,
 applying skill and self-expression.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\color gray
Gray 
\color inherit
corresponds to the safety need — trying to control the existing environment
 to ease stability and day to day work, and making maintenance work to repair
 any problems that arise in it
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\color blue
Blue
\color inherit
 corresponds to the need to do good in the world — to make the lives of
 others better.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The aspect blue does not correspond to a motivation on Maslow's hierarchy,
 but in my view is indeed an axiomatic need.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Additionally, this system delineates an additional 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

meta
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 aspect:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\color lightgray
Steel
\color inherit
 corresponds to the need to fulfill the base needs mentioned above; it should
 deal with decision making itself and the integration of the above stated
 needs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In previous iterations of this project, instrumental aspects (which referred
 to significant mesa objectives) were created; see appendix-B for more details.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By categorizing objects with this system, I am able to more clearly integrate
 between my needs, and see which one I have more or less issues with at
 the moment; it also allows me to remember the higher purpose behind things,
 and thus to be able to better determine the path I should be taking.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection

\bar under
210606B
\bar default
 Projects
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I can optionally farther specify any object with a Project.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A project is defined by
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A mesa objective — that is, a goal I set in order to advance one of the
 higher, base motivations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Systems set to achieve that mesa objective.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The state of said systems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Systems
\emph default
 then, denote a fabric of rules and plans to practice, which will progress
 the project up to its goal, and maintain it.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sum of all the systems of all projects essentially implies my to-do-list;
 unlike the base motives or the mesa-objectives, which detail only desirable
 
\shape slanted
states
\shape default
, the 
\emph on
system
\emph default
 defines a 
\shape slanted
course of action
\shape default
.
 Looking at all project in their corresponding aspects, and the actions
 I need to take to engage with said systems, I should be able to look more
 easily through the timeline, and make sure I can achieve my mesa goals
 in a timely manner.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a general rule, each project should have a project directory (to be specified
 in a future gray project) and a statement as detailed in 
\shape slanted
System210606C
\shape default
.
 Some projects are created mostly for completion and don't require such
 order and method.
 These are the detailed in this document, in 
\shape slanted
Appendix-C
\shape default
.
 This is mostly meant for relationship projects.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I stylize project with one-word, UPPER_CASE names.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection

\bar under
210610A
\bar default
 Identifiers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to be able to search refer to objects (goals, tasks, decisions,
 etc.) in a convenient manner, while still allowing for renaming/non-naming,
 I will assign each an identifier string in the following manner, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

{TYPE}{DATE}{NUM}{SUB_NUMS}
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, where
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
TYPE refers to the object class (system, decision, goal, etc.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
DATE is the object creation date, formatted 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

yymmdd
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
NUM is a letter enumerating the objects of that type that were created that
 day, prior: — for example for the third decision made in the same day,
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

C
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If creating identifier for a sub-item, SUB_NUMS will be dash - delimited
 list of numbers indicating the sub-item number.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, presume this is written in the system sub-item 
\shape slanted
Identifiers
\shape default
, the first sub-item of the system Statements, which was the third system
 for the project created on 2021-06-06.
 Therefore, it gets the identifier 
\shape slanted
System
\shape default
210606C-1.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If referring to an object outside the current project scope, add 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

{PROJECT}/
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 prefix — e.g 
\shape slanted
CONTROL/System
\shape default
210606C-1
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

{PROJECT}/
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

{NAME}
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 should be 
\shape slanted
slanted
\shape default
 when using to refer an object.
 All of the ID should be 
\bar under
underlined
\bar default
 when declared.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main idea is that I can now refer to other objects (for example, say,
 in a project statement as detailed in 
\shape slanted
System
\shape default
210606C-2, independent of possible title changes (or lack of title), and
 independent of changes in order (for example 4.3.1, the titling index of
 this sub-item, is not necessarily consistent).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection

\bar under
210606D
\bar default
 Proposals
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This system is supposed to formalize my decision making process, and does
 so very simply:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
An idea I have that I'm thinking about implementing is called a proposal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
An Open Proposal is a proposal that I am currently thinking about.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A Closed Proposal is a proposal that I have decided either to implement
 in some form or reject.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A Decision is a proposal scheduled to be implemented.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main idea is to be used in integration with 
\shape slanted
System210606C
\shape default
, to be written down.
 To prevent ideas from floating around aimlessly until fading, and to empower
 the act of decision by writing down the thought.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection

\bar under
210606C
\bar default
 Statements
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Statements are documents which detail projects and progress — as said, the
 goals, plan, and state, as well as the history of those.
 The idea being that it will allow me to organize what I need and wish to
 do and the circumstances surrounding these tasks, and allow me to learn
 and improve both in general and in the stated project.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection

\bar under
210606C-1
\bar default
 Project Statements
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Every project will have a statement, delineating its goal, systems, and
 status, as well as reflections upon it to optimize its process.
 Similar statements will be created for various time scopes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A directory named 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Statements
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 should be created in the project directory.
 For each project defined, it should have a NAME.lyx file, which outlines
 the Project in the following tree-like manner:
\end_layout

Rules:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
These Project Statements should be created together with the matching project.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
As long as the initial project statement is not complete, no new projects
 may be formally created.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Work on new project that cannot be formally created may be placed in temporary
 locations as long as the embargo continues, but it should be minimized
 and finishing the statement should be in high priority.
 This is done in order to avoid having the project directories and files
 without an actual organizing document, and to prevent the state from becoming
 steadily worse until fixing it is unfeasible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Project statements should be updated upon relevant state changes.
 In order to improve accuracy, this should happen as soon as possible (though
 without high priority).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection

\bar under
210606C-2
\bar default
 Progress Statements 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Having created project statements, I now want to create a system that will
 strengthen the integration of my projects and tasks together, to inform
 my decision making at any given point.
 For this reason, the progress statement subsystem instructs the creation
 of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Progress Statements
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, that are similar to the project statements, but refer to multiple projects
 in a specific time scope — specifically, in sequence, 
\family typewriter
Day-Week-Month-Season-Year
\family default
.
 The matching file names are Daily.lyx, Weekly.lyx, Monthly.lyx, Season.lyx
 Yearly.lyx, and they should be updated with each passage.
\end_layout
